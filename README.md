TEAM-CYPHER  presents a transformative approach to education, emphasizing engagement, personalization, and visual comprehension through its "EDU-NOVA" project. This innovative solution addresses critical shortcomings in traditional learning systems, such as stress, monotony, and a lack of practical application, by integrating AI-driven tools into the learning process.

The project consists of five key modules:

1. EdHook: Interactive learning hooks using current events, facts, stories, text, images, questions, and videos to maintain student interest and foster stress-free learning.
2. EdDox: AI-powered PDF analysis for quick and contextual answers, enabling efficient learning by simplifying access to information.
3. EdPath: A personalized career guidance system offering tailored roadmaps, course recommendations, and resource links to help students achieve their career goals.
4. EdVision: A tool that converts diagrams and flowcharts into textual explanations, enhancing comprehension through visual and textual integration.
5. EdMockTest: A dynamic mock test platform for competitive exams like JEE and NEET, featuring difficulty adjustments and personalized question sets.

By leveraging these modules, the EDU-NOVA initiative delivers a comprehensive, engaging, and effective educational experience, empowering students to achieve their academic and career aspirations.
